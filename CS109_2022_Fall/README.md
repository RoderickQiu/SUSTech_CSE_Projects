## How to run

1. Download IntelliJ IDEA, and we assume that the Chinese language pack and the new UI are enabled.
2. Open the `Chess` subfolder in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Select `构建` -> `构建工件`->`Chess.jar`->`编辑`, and go `项目设置` -> `库` in the new window, and ensure that `flatlaf` and `gson` was downloaded for the project. If not, please select `从 Maven 仓库下载库`, and search for `formdev.flatlaf`(version 3) and `google.code.gson`(version 2) and add them for the project.
4. Now, run the `Run`  configuration, it should now work.
